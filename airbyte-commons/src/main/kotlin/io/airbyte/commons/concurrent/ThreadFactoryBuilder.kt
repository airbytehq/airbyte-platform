 * A builder for creating instances of ThreadFactory with configurable parameters.
 *
 * This class simplifies the creation of threads by allowing customization of thread naming through
 * a formatted name pattern. Users may specify a name format for newly created threads, providing
 * better identification and debugging for threads within multi-threaded applications.
 *
 * Threads created using the built ThreadFactory will have their names formatted based
 * on the specified name pattern if one is provided. If no name format is specified, the default
 * thread naming behavior will apply.
