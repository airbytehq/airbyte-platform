/**
 * React-hook-form will set field values to empty string if they got touched by the user and to undefined if the field gets registered without use interaction.
 * In some cases this can be undesirable, e.g. when objects are compared or when the data is sent to the server.
 * This helper function recursively removes all properties that contain empty strings or undefined as value.
 *
 * In most cases it should be used by passing the values object from the form submit callback to this function before sending data to the server.
 *
 * Things to consider:
 * * This will mutate the object passed to it.
 * * This will remove empty strings even if the properties are required
 * * This will remove strings that are empty after trimming
 * * This will remove properties that are undefined
 * * This will not remove properties that are null
