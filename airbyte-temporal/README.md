# airbyte-temporal

This module implements a custom version of what the Temporal autosetup image is doing. Because Temporal does not recommend the autosetup be used in production, we had to add some modifications. It ensures that the temporalDB schema will get upgraded if the temporal version is updated.

## Testing a temporal migration

`tools/bin/test-temporal-migration.sh` is available to test that a bump of the temporal version won't break the docker compose build. Here is what 
the script does:
- checkout master
- build the docker image
- run docker compose up in the background
- Sleep for 75 secondes
- shutdown docker compose
- checkout the commit being tested
- build the docker image
- run docker compose up.

At the end of the script you should be able to access a local airbyte in `localhost:8000`.
