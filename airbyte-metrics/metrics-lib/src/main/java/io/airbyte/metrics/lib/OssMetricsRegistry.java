/**
 * Enum source of truth of all Airbyte metrics. Each enum value represent a metric and is linked to
 * an application and contains a description to make it easier to understand.
 * <p>
 * Each object of the enum actually represent a metric, so the Registry name is misleading. The
 * reason 'Registry' is in the name is to emphasize this enum's purpose as a source of truth for all
 * metrics. This also helps code readability i.e. AirbyteMetricsRegistry.metricA.
 * <p>
 * Metric Name Convention (adapted from
 * https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/guide/what-best-practices-are-recommended-for-naming-metrics-and-tags/):
 * <p>
 * - Use lowercase. Metric names are case-sensitive.
 * <p>
 * - Use underscore to delimit names with multiple words.
 * <p>
 * - No spaces. This makes the metric confusing to read.
 * <p>
 * - Avoid numbers. This makes the metric confusing to read. Numbers should only be used as a
 * <p>
 * - Add units at name end if applicable. This is especially relevant for time units.
 * <p>
 * - Include the time period in the name if the metric is meant to be run at a certain interval.
 * <p>
 * Note: These names are used as metric name prefixes. Changing these names will affect
 * dashboard/alerts and our public Datadog integration. Please consult the platform teams if unsure.
