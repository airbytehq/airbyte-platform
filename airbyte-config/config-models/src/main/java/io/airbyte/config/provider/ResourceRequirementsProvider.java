/**
 * ResourceRequirementsProvider abstraction.
 * <p>
 * We are classifying resources with a type and a subType. The type being one of Source, Destination
 * and Orchestrator. For a Source, the subType is one of (api, database, file, custom). The subType
 * for destinations and orchestrators is inherited from the source of the same connection. The
 * reason is that the source sets the expectations related to the throughput of a sync. For example,
 * an API source is most likely going to be slower than a database source and won't be able to
 * leverage as much CPU. Similarly, Orchestrators and Destinations should have a load dependent on
 * the throughput from the source.
 * <p>
 * The notion of variant is to enable global classes on top of the subType. For example, we could
 * imagine a low/high resources model based on the urgency of a job. Variant is here to open this
 * possibility.
